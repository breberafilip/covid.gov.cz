If one of them later tests positive for COVID-19, the app will show the other users an anonymous alert and <strong>recommend further steps</strong>. The app can tell how close you were to other eRouška users and for what period of time. It knows that an encounter took place, <strong>but it doesn't know where</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have been infected, you will receive a unique code</strong> together with your test results. If you <strong>enter this code into eRouška</strong>, the app can <strong>alert potentially infected users</strong> about a risky encounter. Since they will be aware of the fact that they met with someone positive, they will be able to behave more responsibly and <strong>protect those in high risk groups.</strong></p>\n<h2>I got an SMS, telling me I'm positive</h2>\n<p>If you received a positive PCR test result, read the <a href=\"https://erouska.cz/en/sms\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\">detailed instructions</a>. If the potentially infected are <strong>separated </strong>from others in time, this could <strong>prevent </strong>many more from <strong>contracting the illness</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please, enter the code into eRouška. This information is entered anonymously. Even one code can prevent dozens of people from getting infected.</p>\n"},"questions_answers":[{"question":"If I get an alert that I met with someone positive, do I automatically have to go into quarantine?","value":"No. But you should act even more responsibly and monitor your health in the span of 14 days from the risky encounter."},{"question":"Does eRouška keep track of my movements?","value":"No."},{"question":"Does anyone other than me find out that I got an alert about meeting someone positive?","value":"No."}],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"Purpose of the measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/purpose-measures","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Where will the test results be sent?","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/where-will-test-results-be-sent","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Self-reporting","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/self-reporting","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Quarantine","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/quarantine","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Infection and general measures","path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/erouska-efacemask"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"links":[{"uri":"https://erouska.cz/en/caste-dotazy","title":"eRouška FAQ"}],"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/infection-and-general-measures/erouska-efacemask","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/onemocneni-obecne-o-opatrenich/erouska"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","209121880","2446164016","3292154253"]}

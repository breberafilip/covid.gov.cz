Tips on handling stress and relationships.","content":{"processed":"<h2>Recommendations for handling the state of emergency</h2>\n<p>Being in some form of isolation or quarantine can be very challenging. If possible, still maintain your social contacts through the online world during this time. Try to keep your own habits and as constant as possible. It is important to eat in a balanced way, to have enough sleep and rest, and also to strive for physical and mental activity. It's a good idea to use stress management methods that have worked for you before and have proven to be effective. There are many ways to reduce stress, such as relaxation or meditation.</p>\n<p>You can learn about the basic recommendations for maintaining mental health in the <a href=\"/en/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-hygiene\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mental hygiene</a> section.</p>\n<p>If you feel that you need to talk to someone, either about a specific problem or just to talk, contact one of the crisis lines. You can find a list of them in the <a href=\"/en/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/helplines\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psychological help</a> section.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations for managing cohabitation in an emergency </strong></p>\n<p>Spending quarantine in a couple or family can be an advantage and a disadvantage. You and your partner and family can support each other, but there is also a risk that in time you will \"start getting on each other's nerves.\"</p>\n<p>What to do to avoid conflicts?  </p>\n<ul><li>It is essential to arm yourself with a dose of patience and tolerance - with a pandemic, the dynamics of your coexistence are likely to change significantly, and it will take everyone a long time to come to terms with the situation.</li>\n<li>Try to divide the time into the time spent on joint activities and the time that each of you devotes to yourself.</li>\n<li>If there are also children in the household, try to divide taking care of them.</li>\n<li>These times are also demanding in terms of worries and fears - about the health of loved ones, about the future. Try to talk to your partner about your concerns.</li>\n<li>Do not bottle your feelings inside, try, and talk about them with your partner and children. If you resolve the dispute right away, the situation is far less likely to escalate.</li>\n<li>Remember that the situation also affects children. They don't see friends, they have nowhere to exhaust their energy. If you suddenly find the space of the apartment smaller than usual, try to go for a walk in the fresh air. A short walk will certainly benefit you.</li>\n<li>Have some fun - watch a movie, cook with your family or play a board game.</li>\n</ul>"},"questions_answers":[],"relationships":{"related_situations":[{"title":"Helplines","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/helplines","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Help for a close one","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/help-close-one","langcode":"en"}},{"title":"Mental hygiene","path":{"alias":"/situations/stress-and-handling-impacts-pandemic/mental-hygiene","langcode":"en"}}],"region":[],"situation_type":{"name":"Parents","path":{"alias":"/situations/parents"}},"measures":[]},"path":{"alias":"/situations/parents/psychological-help-parents"},"changed":"2020-11-10T22:12:35+00:00","valid_from":null,"links":[{"uri":"https://www.zachranny-kruh.cz/pro-verejnost/pomoc-v-krizi/ostatni-pomoci/domaci-nasili/ceska-republika/bily-kruh-bezpeci-dona-linka.html","title":"Union of Family Lawyers"}],"valid_to":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/situations/parents/psychological-help-parents","langCode":"en","languageVariants":{"cs":"/situace/rodice/psychologicka-pomoc-rodicum"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["106679691","1446925061","209121880","2446164016","3292154253"]}

The general ban on presence of the public in restaurants applies. You can meet with your loved ones after the wedding ceremony for example at home. Follow the general rules related to free movement and hygienic regulations, even during the consuming of food and the toast.</p>\n<p>During the ceremony there is an exception from the obligation to wear a face mask. You have to put your mask back on once the ceremony is over. You can only take it off for the necessary amount of time when taking a photo.</p>\n<p>Weddings are allowed to happen but there is a limited amount of guests and it is necessary to follow all hygienic regulations. It is up to you whether you want to get married now or wait until a better epidemiological situation.
